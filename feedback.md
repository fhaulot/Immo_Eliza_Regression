## feedback

- good readme, maybe add graphs with your results 
- nice you've added the slides deck there
- OOP is not consistant, sometimes you create a class and sometimes you don't.
- missing docstring and typing
- interesting logic, you have a main.py file and a pipeline to automatically test different algos. I like it but it would have been possible to automate everything from main.py :) But good logic
- Your project is easy to read and understand, awesome
- Your best model is robust even if the accuracy is not amazing, that's already an interesting result
- commits are unbalanced. Some team members have commited a lot and some others almost not. Is it a team organisation issue or have you organized things differently? In the future try to make everything using git so it's easy to see how much a team member has contributed to the project.

Overall good work and project!! :fire:
